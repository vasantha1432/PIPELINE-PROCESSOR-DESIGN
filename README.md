# THIS CODE IS ABOUT PIPELINE PROCESSOR .THE PIPELINE PROCESSOR IS A CPU DESIGNED IT WILL ENHANCES THE INSTRUCTIONS BY DIVIDEDING THE EXECUTION INTO MULTIPLE STAGES .WHERE DIFFERENT INSTRUCTION CAN WORK SIMULTANEOUSLY BECAUSE OF THIS THE SPEED AND EFFICIENCY WILL INCREASES.IN THE CODE I USED INSTRUCTION FETCH (IF) ,INSTRUCTION DECODE(ID),EXECUTION(EX),MEMORY ACCESS (MEM),WRITE BACK(WB).THIS CODE WILL IMPLEMENT A 5 STAGE PIPELINED PROCESSOR ,HANDLING BASIC INSTRUCTION EXECUTION WITH DATA AND CONTROL REGUSTERS TO STORE INTERMEDIATE RESULTS. INCLUDES MEMORY MODULES FOR FETCHING AND STORING INSTRUCTIONS AND DATA. THE DATA WILL BE TAKEN AND ADDTION,SUBTRACTION,LOAD WILL BE PERFORMED IN THIS CODE . I WRITTEN TESTBENCH ALONG WITH CODE IN ONE FOLDER . THE SOFTWARE I USED TO WRITE CODE IS "VIVADO 2023.2".THERE ARE SO MANY APPLICATION FOR PIPELINE PROCESSOR LIKE IN DESKTOPS,LAPTOPS,EMBEDDED SYSTEMS. THE RESOURCES I USED IS CHAT GPT AND YOUTUBE.
